# Matt Stjernholm - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

While I checked the bucket that I had 50-1000 hours of programming experience coming into turing, I still felt like the projects in Echo were always just a bit beyond my reach.  After struggling through Echo the first couple of weeks, I set my sights on completing module 1 without having to drop down to Foxtrot.  Despite banging my head into the keyboard for countless hours on these projects (and consistently feeling bhind), I was satisfied with not only grinding it out through Echo, but for also receiving a 3 or higher on every evaluation.  Looking ahead, I'm hoping the extra effort in Module 1 will translate to being one step closer to my main objective of being able to build anything and everything that can be dreamt up.  

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Andrew  
Challenge: Highest Scoring Word  
#####Overall Score: 3

Notes:

* Very solid with use of blocks and enumerables.
* Testing was good, but tended to get ahead of himself and not completely drive with testing.
* Was receptive to collaboration and advice.
* Is very quick and comfortable with his machine, but could make some small workflow improvements and become exponentially better.

### Work

Below are the individual projects that I completed:

#### Sorting Suite

Assessed By: Josh  
#####Overall Score: 3


#####Functional Expectations: 3
* No comments.

#####Testing: 3
* Can be run with mrspec
* All tests pass (20 examples)
* Tests edge cases

#####Ruby Style: 3
* No syntax errors
* Almost correct indentation, but was actually caused by elsif instead of else
* Be kind to yourself: choose names that help you think about what the variable means :)
* Style is fine

#####Organization: 4
* Tests in test dir, files in lib dir
* Each class has its own file
* Using git

#### Linked List

#####Overall Score: 3

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 4
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby: 3

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/binary-search-tree)

Assessed By: Josh  
#####Overall: 3

#####Functional Expectations :3

#####TDD: 4

* Tests all pass
* Pretty good test names, could be a tad bit more descriptive
* Use abstractions in test, too

#####Encapsulation: 3

* When your class uses all the shit of another class like node (this is commonly called "feature envy") that is an indicator that the functionality you are using belongs to the thing with all the attributes that you're working with.

#####Fundamental Ruby Style: 3

* Poor Indentation

#####Enumerables & Collections: 3

* No comments

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)


Assessed By: Jeff  
#####Overall Score: 3

* Like seeing 20 tests off the bat
* Try to use fewer instance variables
* Like the method decomposition, but take it one step further
* Like that you were able to brute force the read tests when struggling
* Continue refining your testing techniques at multiple levels

* Fundamental Ruby: 3
* TDD: 3
* Components: 3

## Team

### Group Projects

Headcount was a beast.  I'm happy and proud to be finished with it :)

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/headcount)  
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Assessed By Josh  
Teammate: Ross Edfort  
Overall Score: 3

#####1. Overall Functionality: 4

* Passes all of the test harness methods, minus the two we discussed and decided should be changed just before sitting down to do this :P
* Also, they wrote all the analysis methods (including the one that failed ;)

#####2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

* I didn't have any issues with anything

##### 3. Test-Driven Development: 4

* All unit tests pass
* "All" test harness tests pass
* Listened to me rant nostalgically and inpirationally, if we're completely honest, about testing for like 20 minutes or something.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

* LoadCSV and DistrictRepository should ideally know very little about each other.
* For example, we might make a DistrictRepository from some JSON data, or some SQL data,
or a hash for a test. So lets not inherit from LoadCSV.


## Community

### Giving Feedback

* For Ross Edfort - "Ross was a great partner to pair with, and a lot of the success that we had on the project was likely due to our ability to work well together.  We both have similar work styles and we're on the same page with how much time and effort we intended to put in to headcount.  There were a lot of long stretches where we sat in front of the computer, stumped on a problem for hours, and relied on each other to keep putting one foot in front of the other.  After week of countless hours, expletive-filled-rants, and high fives, we learned a ton more about programming and also built rapport with one another that we likely would not have found otherwise.  Overall: great first experience for a pairing project!"

* For Jason Pilz - "Jason consistently pushed me to be a better student throughout Module 1.  His positive outlook and “you can do it” attitude is a big reason why I stuck around in the Echo group — which I’m extremely grateful for.  On top of that, Jason showed me countless keybinding shortcuts, Atom add-ons, and tricks that streamlined my workflow and made me more efficient.  Can’t imagine where I’d be without Jason, and I look forward to having him around next module!"

### Being a Community Member

*  "Matt was an incredibly easy person to get along with and work with. When we divided responsibilities Matt always came back with his share completed. When we paired he was constantly contributing to the task at hand and had useful insights. His knowledge and work ethic were extremely admirable. Overall, I would be thrilled to work with Matt on a future project."   
-- Ross Edfort (Headcount Partner)

* "Working with Matt during this module has been a pleasure. His motivation and dedication inspires me to continue to push when feeling tired or discouraged. I have improved my programming and pairing skills this module with Matt’s help. I have observed Matt being willing and excited to help all cohort-mates whenever he is given the opportunity."   
-- Jason Pilz (The *original* O.G.)

### Playing a Part  

* Trying to help others on projects that I've done -- removing roadblocks and helping them move past pieces that they're stuck on.

* Staying

* Writing additional tests for the Headcount Spec Harness that the class needed to finish the project.  Also, spending 3+ hours on the night headcount was due to help people troubleshoot issues they were having with out tests.
