### Attendance

Missed 1/2 day on afternoon of Friday, 9/4, for a wedding.

### Work

While I checked the bucket that I had 50-1000 hours of programming experience coming into turing, I still felt like the projects in Echo were always just a bit beyond my reach.  I smashed my head into the keyboard for countless hours on these projects -- but overall, I'm really satisfied with how they came out.
