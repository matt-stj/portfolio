### Your Mission

While I checked the bucket that I had 50-1000 hours of programming experience coming into turing, I still felt like the projects in Echo were always just a bit beyond my reach.  After struggling through Echo the first couple of weeks, I set my sights on completing module 1 without having to drop down to Foxtrot.  Despite banging my head into the keyboard for countless hours on these projects (and consistently feeling bhind), I was satisfied with not only grinding it out through Echo, but for also receiving a 3 or higher on every evaluation.  Looking ahead, I'm hoping the extra effort in Module 1 will translate to being one step closer to my main objective of being able to build anything and everything that can be dreamt up.  

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Andrew
Challenge: Highest Scoring Word

Notes:

* Very solid with use of blocks and enumerables.
* Testing was good, but tended to get ahead of himself and not completely drive with testing.
* Was receptive to collaboration and advice.
* Is very quick and comfortable with his machine, but could make some small workflow improvements and become exponentially better.


##### 1. Ruby Syntax & API - 3

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

##### 2. Ruby Style - 3

* 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

##### 3. Blocks & Enumerations - 4

* 4: Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks

##### 4. Testing - 3

* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

##### 5. Workflow - 3

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

##### 6. Collaboration - 3

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/binary-search-tree)
* [Original Assignment]()

Assessed By: Josh
Overall: 3

#####Functional Expectations :3

#####TDD: 4

* Tests all pass
* Pretty good test names, could be a tad bit more descriptive
* Use abstractions in test, too

#####Encapsulation: 3

* When your class uses all the shit of another class like node (this is commonly called "feature envy") that is an indicator that the functionality you are using belongs to the thing with all the attributes that you're working with.

#####Fundamental Ruby Style: 3

* Poor Indentation

#####Enumerables & Collections: 3

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment]()

Assessed By: Jeff
Overall Score: 3

* Like seeing 20 tests off the bat
* Try to use fewer instance variables
* Like the method decomposition, but take it one step further
* Like that you were able to brute force the read tests when struggling
* Continue refining your testing techniques at multiple levels

Overall: 3
Fundamental Ruby: 3
TDD: 3
Components: 3
