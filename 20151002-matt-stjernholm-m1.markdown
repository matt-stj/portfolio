### Your Mission

While I checked the bucket that I had 50-1000 hours of programming experience coming into turing, I still felt like the projects in Echo were always just a bit beyond my reach.  After struggling through Echo the first couple of weeks, I set my sights on completing module 1 without having to drop down to Foxtrot.  Despite banging my head into the keyboard for countless hours on these projects (and consistently feeling bhind), I was satisfied with not only grinding it out through Echo, but for also receiving a 3 or higher on every evaluation.  Looking ahead, I'm hoping the extra effort in Module 1 will translate to being one step closer to my main objective of being able to build anything and everything that can be dreamt up.  

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Andrew

Challenge: Highest Scoring Word

Notes:

* Very solid with use of blocks and enumerables.
* Testing was good, but tended to get ahead of himself and not completely drive with testing.
* Was receptive to collaboration and advice.
* Is very quick and comfortable with his machine, but could make some small workflow improvements and become exponentially better.


##### 1. Ruby Syntax & API - 3

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

##### 2. Ruby Style - 3

* 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

#####3. Blocks & Enumerations - 4

* 4: Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks

#####4. Testing - 3

* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

#####5. Workflow - 3

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#####6. Collaboration - 3

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

Assessed By: Josh

#####Overall Score: 3


#####Functional Expectations: 3

#####Testing: 3
* Can be run with mrspec
* All tests pass (20 examples)
* Tests edge cases

#####Ruby Style: 3
* No syntax errors
* Almost correct indentation, but was actually caused by elsif instead of else
* Be kind to yourself: choose names that help you think about what the variable means :)
* Style is fine

#####Organization: 4
* Tests in test dir, files in lib dir
* Each class has its own file
* Using git

Assessed By: Tess

Overall Score: 3

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 4
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/binary-search-tree)

Assessed By: Josh

#####Overall: 3

#####Functional Expectations :3

#####TDD: 4

* Tests all pass
* Pretty good test names, could be a tad bit more descriptive
* Use abstractions in test, too

#####Encapsulation: 3

* When your class uses all the shit of another class like node (this is commonly called "feature envy") that is an indicator that the functionality you are using belongs to the thing with all the attributes that you're working with.

#####Fundamental Ruby Style: 3

* Poor Indentation

#####Enumerables & Collections: 3

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/night_writer)

Assessed By: Jeff

#####Overall Score: 3

* Like seeing 20 tests off the bat
* Try to use fewer instance variables
* Like the method decomposition, but take it one step further
* Like that you were able to brute force the read tests when struggling
* Continue refining your testing techniques at multiple levels

* Overall: 3
* Fundamental Ruby: 3
* TDD: 3
* Components: 3

### Projects

Headcount was a beast.  I'm happy and proud to be finished with it :)

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)

Assessed By Josh
Overall Score: 3

#####1. Overall Functionality

Score: 4

* Passes all of the test harness methods, minus the two we discussed and decided should be changed just before sitting down to do this :P
* Also, they wrote all the analysis methods (including the one that failed ;)

#####2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

Score: 3

* I didn't have any issues with anything

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

Score: 4

* All unit tests pass
* "All" test harness tests pass
* Listened to me rant nostalgically and inpirationally, if we're completely honest, about testing for like 20 minutes or something.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

Score: 3

* LoadCSV and DistrictRepository should ideally know very little about each other.
* For example, we might make a DistrictRepository from some JSON data, or some SQL data,
or a hash for a test. So lets not inherit from LoadCSV.
